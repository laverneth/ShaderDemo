This is the demo for pixelated/band limited light.
It is a very simple shader!

Light is band limited by choosing an amount of levels of grey in the final shader color. Here you see the result on a grey gradient from black to white.

The contrast is then adjusted, notice how it change the importance of certain nuances of grey in the gradient.

The brightness can be adjusted too, shifting the leveled values to the left or to the right.

The number of pixels (from 1 to 8) merging can be also picked. It reflects how many pixels in the rendered image will be merged into a single pixel in the final image (for a single direction. For example choosing  means that the final pixel will represent a block of 4-by-4 pixels).

That's all folks!
Enjoy!
